# FlashLoanTest

Firstly you need to create .env file and fill it according to .env.example file.

For running test script you will need to install packages with
``` npm install ```

Then run 

``` npm run compile ``` 

to compile all contracts.

And then run 

``` npm run deploy ``` 

to deploy contract and interact with FlashLoan. It will fail for now because of their service issue.
